# Another React Starter App!
This is where I like to start making singe page React apps. If you like it too, please use + feel free to PR.
The goal here is to get in all the pieces that I think I'm quite likely to use in any given app – not necessarily all the bells and whistles.

## Gear
- React
- Redux
- SCSS (built using node-sass)
- Express (ready to go to build additional views, like an API)
- Livereload (requires plugin to be installed on your browser)
- Hot Module Reloading


## Out of the box
```
npm install
```
To get started. This will also build the production app as a post-build. That's a nice check to be sure the build processes are working correctly in your environment and also sets you up to deply to place like heroku.

```
npm run dev
```
Find the app at `localhost:3000`
Starts the web server as well as the `webpack-dev-server` and `livereload` because we live in a sick kafka-esque distopia where it take 3 servers to run your dev process.
Starts watchers on javascript and SCSS, pop on livereload and any changes you make anywhere in the `/src` directory should automatically present in the browser.


```
npm run build
```
Builds and minifies the frontend JS and SCSS and builds the server.
You can now fire up `node ./server` and your production app should be ready to go at `localhost:3000`
